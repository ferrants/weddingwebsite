## Weekend Events

Matt and Meredith will be hosting a Welcome Cocktails on Friday, 8/9 at 7pm in the Cliff Lodge's Primrose Lounge on the same level as the lobby.

Wedding Ceremony is at 4pm on 8/10 at the Cliff Lodge's Magpie Terrace on level L1, followed by dinner and dancing with musical performance by [Shuffle](https://www.shuffleslc.com/) at the same location.

Matt and Meredith will be hosting a Farewell Brunch on Sunday, 8/11 from 9am to 11am at the Snowbird Center, across the bridge on the west end of the Cliff Lodge's level L1.

## Wedding Attire

Matt and Meredith ask that you wear [cocktail attire](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=cocktail+attire) to the wedding ceremony and reception. A couple tips:
- Wear pants nicer than jeans.
- Don't wear a white dress. You should know better than that.
- Wear comfy shoes that you can dance all night in. Ladies, bring flats to change into if you want.
- Wear whatever you would like to at the Welcome Cocktails and Brunch.
- Don't worry, you'll look great.

## Lodging

Lodging will be available at the Cliff Lodge and other locations at Snowbird Ski Resort, in Little Cottonwood Canyon. Call 800-453-3000 and mention the "Thompson-Ferrante Wedding" to reserve a room at the Cliff Lodge. Alternatively, you can book online via [snowbird.com](http://www.snowbird.com) and use the wedding code, "2CK5SZ", but it is supposedly easier to call. Staying at the Cliff Lodge gets you access to the Cliff Lodge Spa included. The "Cliff Club" and "Cliff Lodge" are two sides of the same building, so if you are lodging in either, don't be worried. If you run into any issues booking, don't hesitate to contact Matt or Meredith.

Ask about the Mountain Condos at the Cliff Lodge if you're interested in two bedrooms with a living room space. Most also have a hot tub.

The Lodge at Snowbird is right next to the Cliff Lodge and is a little bit cheaper, you should be able to book through the same phone number and block.

If you plan to just stay at Snowbird, you probably won't need a car. You can book a shuttle through Snowbird (800-453-3000) for $76 per person, but it would be cheaper to just take an Uber or Lyft from the airport, probably $40-$60 for the whole ride.

If you're going to do more exploring around UT, you probably want to rent a car. Self-parking is free or you can do Valet at the lodge fo $12 a day.
